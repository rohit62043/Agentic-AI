## 🔍 What is Generative AI?

### ✅ Definition:
Generative AI refers to a class of AI models capable of generating new data — including:
- Text
- Images
- Code
- Audio
- Video

These outputs closely mimic human-generated content.

### 🚀 Evolution:
- Rapid development over 3 years
- Key milestone: ChatGPT
- Major players: GPT, Gemini, Claude, Grok, DALL·E, Midjourney, Code Llama, Sora, ElevenLabs

### 🧠 How It Works:
- Learns the **distribution** of training data
- Can generate new samples that look like the real thing

### 🆚 Traditional AI:
- Traditional AI finds relationships between input-output
- Examples: Spam classification, medical diagnosis, regression
- Generative AI focuses on learning patterns to generate new data (not just classify or predict)

### 💼 Use Cases:
- **Content generation**: Blogs, emails, ads
- **Code assistance**: Autocompletion, debugging
- **Customer support**: Chatbots
- **Design**: Infographics, thumbnails
- **Education**: Personalized tutoring, summaries
- **Marketing**: Video ads, product visuals

## 🧪 Practical Scenario: Hiring Using Generative AI

### Problem:
Hiring a backend engineer (2-4 years experience)

### Steps Automated by GenAI Chatbot:
1. Drafts Job Description (JD)
2. Recommends platforms for posting jobs
3. Helps screen resumes
4. Generates interview invitation emails
5. Suggests interview questions
6. Drafts offer letter

### Limitations of GenAI:
- **Reactive:** Needs manual prompts
- **No Memory:** Cannot recall past steps
- **Generic Output:** Lacks company context
- **No Autonomy:** Can't take action (e.g., post JD)

---

## 🧠 Improvements Using RAG + Tool Integration

### Enhancements:
- Company-specific responses via RAG
- Resume parsing tools for screening
- Drafting emails/interview questions with templates
- Access to HR tools (calendar, email, ATS)

### Tool-Augmented Chatbot Capabilities:
- Posts jobs via APIs
- Boosts listings when response is low
- Parses resumes, schedules interviews
- Sends offer letters & onboarding emails

### Still Limited:
- Reactive
- Stateless (no memory)
- Can’t self-adapt

## 🤖 What is Agentic AI?

### ✅ Definition:
Agentic AI is an **autonomous**, **proactive**, and **context-aware** system that plans, reasons, and acts toward achieving a defined goal.

### 🧭 Key Features:
- Understands **end-goal**
- **Plans** steps needed
- **Executes** actions with minimal guidance
- Integrates **tools + memory**
- Adapts to new situations

### Scenario: Agentic AI for Hiring
1. Reads hiring goal (e.g., backend engineer)
2. Drafts JD, posts it online
3. Monitors response & suggests improvements
4. Screens resumes
5. Schedules interviews
6. Sends offers
7. Onboards new hire

Each step is **autonomously handled**, and the agent **communicates, plans, adapts, and takes initiative**.

## ⚖️ Summary: GenAI vs Agentic AI

| Feature | Generative AI | Agentic AI |
|--------|----------------|--------------|
| Nature | Reactive | Proactive |
| Output | Content generation | Goal completion |
| Tools | Prompt-based | Tool-integrated |
| Context | Stateless | Context-aware & adaptive |
| Autonomy | Requires human input | Executes with minimal supervision |

### 📎 Key Takeaway:
> Generative AI is a **capability**, while Agentic AI is a **behavior**. Agentic AI uses generative AI (e.g., LLMs) as building blocks to achieve complex goals autonomously.
