# 🧠 In-Depth Notes on Agentic AI using LangGraph

---

## 📌 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI refers to AI systems that can:

- Take a **goal from the user**
- **Independently** plan and execute steps
- Complete the task with **minimal human intervention**

**Key Difference from Generative AI:**

| Generative AI            | Agentic AI                           |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| Reactive                 | Proactive                            |
| Responds to prompts      | Plans and executes tasks             |
| Needs step-by-step input | Acts autonomously with minimal input |

**Example – Planning a Goa Trip**:

- **Generative AI**: Answers questions like "Best hotel in Goa?", one at a time.
- **Agentic AI**: Takes the high-level goal "Plan my Goa trip" and autonomously books travel, hotels, and makes an itinerary.

## 🧪 Real-World Example – AI Recruiter

An **Agentic AI chatbot** is tasked to hire a backend engineer. The steps include:

1. **Goal Input**: Recruiter provides requirements (remote, experience level)
2. **Plan Creation**:
   - Draft JD
   - Post on platforms
   - Monitor applications
   - Screen & schedule interviews
   - Send offer letters
   - Onboard candidate
3. **Execution & Adaptation**:
   - Suggest changes if response is low
   - Parse resumes
   - Schedule & remind for interviews
   - Draft & send offers
   - Automate onboarding

> ✅ **Key Insight**: The system is highly autonomous and only loops in humans when necessary (e.g. offer approvals).

## 🔑 6 Core Characteristics of Agentic AI

### 1. **Autonomy**

- Acts **independently** to achieve goals
- Chooses tools, makes decisions, and executes tasks
- Can be **layered**:
  - Action execution (post job)
  - Tool selection (calendar API)
  - Decision-making (candidate shortlist)

**Control Measures:**

- Human-in-the-loop checkpoints
- Scope-limited permissions
- Policy guardrails
- Emergency override capability

### 2. **Goal-Orientation**

- Agent keeps a **persistent objective** in memory
- All actions are aligned with the goal
- Goals can be:
  - Main objective
  - With constraints (e.g., remote only, salary limits)

**Stored as JSON**:

```json
{
  "goal": "Hire backend engineer",
  "constraints": {"remote": true, "budget": "$100K"},
  "progress": "JD posted",
  "status": "active",
  "created_at": "2025-07-01"
}
```

**Adaptable Goals**:

- Midway switches allowed (e.g., hiring a freelancer if full-time fails)

### 3. **Planning**

- Breaks down a high-level goal into **step-by-step actions**
- Multiple candidate plans created, then evaluated
- Planning treated as a **search problem**:
  - Initial state ➝ Final state
  - Evaluate based on efficiency, risk, tool availability, constraints

### 4. **Reasoning**

- Cognitive capability to make decisions during:
  - **Planning** (tool choice, time estimation)
  - **Execution** (retry on failure, human intervention)

**Example**:

- Chooses Google Search to find salary bands ➝ Informed decision = Reasoning
- Chooses to retry if server fails ➝ Execution reasoning

### 5. **Adaptability**

- Responds to **unexpected conditions**:
  - Low application rate ➝ Run ads
  - Calendar API fails ➝ Use direct messaging
  - Change in goals
- Influenced by **external environment**

### 6. **Context-Awareness**

- Maintains understanding of:
  - Goals, tasks, progress
  - User preferences
  - Platform environment (e.g. LinkedIn job post status)

**Memory Types**:

- **Short-Term**: Session info, immediate tasks
- **Long-Term**: Preferences, policy rules, past decisions

## 🧩 Core Components of Agentic AI Applications

### 1. **Brain** – The LLM

- Interprets goals
- Breaks goals into subgoals
- Performs reasoning
- Selects tools
- Communicates in natural language

### 2. **Orchestrator** – The Task Manager

- Executes plans
- Conditional branching, retries, loops
- Delegates tasks to LLMs or humans
- Frameworks: **LangGraph**, **AutoGen**, **Crew AI**

### 3. **Tools** – External Interfaces

- Perform real-world actions (API, email, database)
- Includes **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- Access factual and domain-specific info

### 4. **Memory** – State Management

- **Short-Term**: Current steps, tasks
- **Long-Term**: Goals, past interactions, preferences, policy rules

### 5. **Supervisor** – Governance & Safety

- Approvals for critical tasks (e.g., sending offer letters)
- Guardrails (e.g., no interviews on weekends)
- Exception handling
- Escalations (e.g., flagging out-of-policy resumes)
